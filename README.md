# Randomized-Based Feedforward Neural Network
Welcome to the Advanced Neural Network for Multi-Class Classification repository! This project implements a PyTorch-based neural network following the novel approach outlined in "A Multi-Class Classification Model with Parameterized Target Outputs for Randomized-Based Feedforward Neural Networks" (Applied Soft Computing, 2023). Our goal is to bring the advanced theoretical framework of parameterized target outputs into a practical, high-performance model that simplifies multi-class classification with enhanced separability and generalization. Through this implementation, we aim to bridge theory and practice, providing a resource for learning and experimentation with PyTorch.
